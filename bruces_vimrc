" MAPpings
" ===================================================================
" Caveat:  Mapping must be "prefix free", ie no mapping must be the
" prefix of any other mapping.  Example:  "map ,abc foo" and
" "map ,abcd bar" will give you the error message "Ambigous mapping".
"
" The backslash ('\') is the only(?) unmapped key, so this is the best
" key to start mappings with as this does not take away a command key.
" However, the backslash is never in the same position with keyboards.
" Eg on German keyboards it is AltGr-sz - don't ask.
" Anyway, I have decided to start mappings with the comma as this
" character is always on the same position on almost all keyboards
" and I hardly have a need for that command.
"
" The following maps get rid of some basic problems:
"
" With Vim-4 the format command was just 'Q' and
" I am too used to it.  So I need this back!
"  nnoremap Q gq
"  vnoremap Q gq
"
" "tal" is the "trailer alignment" filter program
" Hopefully it will ship with Vim one day.
" vmap #t !tal<CR>
"  vmap #t !tal -p 0<CR>
"
" Disable the command 'K' (keyword lookup) by mapping it
" to an "empty command".  (thanks, Lawrence! :-):
  map K :<CR>

"  map K :<BS>
"
" Disable the suspend for ^Z.
" I use Vim under "screen" where a suspend would lose the
" connection to the " terminal - which is what I want to avoid.
"  map <C-Z> :shell
"
" Make CTRL-^ rebound to the *column* in the previous file
"  noremap <C-^> <C-^>`"
"
" Make "gf" rebound to last cursor position (line *and* column)
"  noremap gf gf`"
"
" When I let Vim write the current buffer I frequently mistype the
" command ":w" as ":W" - so I have to remap it to correct this typo:
  nmap :W :w
"
" Are you used to the Unix commands "alias" and "which"?
" I sometimes use these to look up my abbreviations and mappings.
" So I need them available on the command line:
  map :alias map
  map :which map
"
" The command {number}CTRL-G show the current nuffer number, too.
" This is yet another feature that vi does not have.
" As I always want to see the buffer number I map it to CTRL-G.
" Pleae note that here we need to prevent a loop in the mapping by
" using the comamnd "noremap"!
  noremap <C-G> 2<C-G>

" Remaping <C-O> to open a file.  This shortcut is easier on the hands than
" always typeing :n
  map <C-O> :n

"

" Remmaping <C-S> to save the current file

" Many shells allow editing in "Emacs Style".
